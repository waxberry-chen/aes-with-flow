NAME
       LNK-062 (warning) Library %s reference library '%s' is not bound.

DESCRIPTION
       This  library  has  reference libraries that have not been bound to the
       actual library named.  The link_block command cannot resolve references
       to  blocks  or lib cells in the unbound library.  Those references will
       be unresolved.

       The specified block is in a library that  has  not  had  its  reference
       library list set.  The reference library list is used to resolve refer-
       ences to lib_cells and other blocks in the block hierarchy.

WHAT NEXT
       Verify that the reference library list on  this  library  is  set  cor-
       rectly.   Correct  the setting with the set_ref_libs command.  Check to
       see if the TCL search_path variable is  set  to  locate  that  library.
       Verify  that  the  library  is on disk and readable.  Try to explicitly
       open the library with the open_lib command.
